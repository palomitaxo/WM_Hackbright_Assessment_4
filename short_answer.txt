1) What is the difference between a client and a server? 
In the HTTP protocol, which one of these sends requests, and 
which one sends responses?

The client I would say be best represented as a visitor 
aka you and me, we are the ones who send the request to the 
server who acknowledges our request and sends us back a response.

Example: 3 way handshake

-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

A route on a server is the "road" we take to get transported 
to on a URL. When we make a request to go to Google.com, we are
choosing a route to a server we want to go too.

-------------------
3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are 
out of order. Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

3- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
5- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
4- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
2- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
1- The user types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
